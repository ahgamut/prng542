Description: In the STAT 542 lectures, it was mentioned that
    the generation of random numbers would be an interesting exercise,
    although tangentially related to the syllabus of the class. This package
    implements a few simple pseudo-random number generators like 
    LCG, Blum-Blum-Shub, and the Xorshift families.
