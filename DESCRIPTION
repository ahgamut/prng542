Description: In the STAT 542 lectures, it was mentioned that
    the generation of random numbers would be an interesting exercise,
    although tangentially related to the syllabus of the class. This package
    implements a few well-known pseudo-random number generators along with
    some approximation methods to generate uniform and some non-uniform
    distributions.
